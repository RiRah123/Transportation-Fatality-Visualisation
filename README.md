## Project Summary
The `Transportation Fatality Visualisation` is a D3.js multi-line chart visualization, illustrating and comparing the fatality rates (per 100k) for different modes of transportation from 1975 to 2020. With our visualisation, users can filter fatality rates for a particular mode of transportation by selecting or deselecting the provided checkboxes. Also, users can evaluate the numerical fatality rates for all current selected modes of transportation of a given year by hovering on the line chart.
