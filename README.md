## Brief Information about Our Visualization
For our CS 4460 Final Lab, we built an interactive D3.js multi-line chart that visualizes the fatality rates (per 100k) for different modes of transportation from 1975 to present day.

As part of our visualization, we support several user interaction which are as follow:
- Filtering data with check boxes so it includes/excludes fatality rates for a praticular mode of transportation
- Hovering on the line chart will display all fatality rates for all selected modes of transportation for the given time

## Instructions for Run Code
In order to run the code, please follow these instructions:
1. Run the following python command using a terminal: `python -m http.server 8080`
2. Open a browser and enter in `localhost:8080` as the URL
